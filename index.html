    <h2>Repo
      Create a repository</h2>
      <p>Name it 
      Clone, copy url, go to command line (cmd space search terminal)
      Make sure you start on your desktop  (cd desktop) and then navigate to the folder you want to be (cd code )
      type: git clone and paste the url
      Should show as cloned and done. Type ls to see it on your desktop
      Type cd filename then ls to see what’s in the file (a readme)
      Open your code editor and then open the folder you just created 
      Start coding  in that file. If you’ve already been coding in another file, then you have to drag it into your cloned file.  
      Then type git status in your terminal to see 
      Type git add index.html to add that file
      But its not committed, so type git commit -m “initialize main webpage”
      Git push origin main </p>
      
      <p>Then go refresh on GitHub and you should see the index added (initialized)</p>
      
     <p> -Now make a branch, so in terminal: git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME (minute 33 on video)  instead 
      -You add a branch when you want to explore changes but not yet commit them to the main, esp if someone else needs to review them first;
      -So make some changes to your website
      -git add .   (This period means add everything that you have changed.)
      -git status (to check on work
      -git commit -m ‘added a new line’
      -git push origin BRANCH-NAME (make sure you add it to your branch)
      -on your GitHub page, if you refresh you should see the new line in the branch. 
      
      -Click on the new branch in the dropdown menu and you can see your changes. But if you go to the main branch, you’ll see your changes not yet made.
      -Now we need to create a pull request so click Pull Request on the top menu bar, and then describe changes, and click the green button Create Pull Request midway down the page.
      -I had a conflict and I was able to merge it
      -then I clicked merge pull request
      -confirm merge requsest
        
      Go back to terminal. You have to get these changes on your code editor too. Soon our terminal, go to main:
      -git checkout main
      -git pull
      
      FINISHED
     </p>
      Set up a database and a node app and follow the readme n abby’s folder 
       
      
      <p>To make updates without making a pull request
      Git status
      (Optional: git diff  then j for down/ k for up / d a page / q is exit)
      Git add .
      Git commit -m “name”
      Git push  </p>
